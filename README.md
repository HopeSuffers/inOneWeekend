# Weekend to My Weekend RayTracer

Welcome to my Weekend RayTracer project! This repository contains my implementation of the ray tracing algorithm as detailed in the fantastic resource, [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by [Peter Shirley](https://github.com/petershirley). This project serves both as a learning tool and a personal challenge to implement a robust ray tracing engine over a single weekend.

## About The Project

Ray tracing is a rendering technique known for its stunning visual accuracy in simulating the interaction of light with surfaces. While typically compute-intensive, the approach outlined in Peter Shirley's guide simplifies the process, making it accessible for enthusiasts and budding programmers alike. This repository is my take on that simplified model, adapted and coded in C++.
The original repo can be found under the original [RayTracer Github Account](https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io/).

## Features

- **Basic Ray Tracing**: Implements core ray tracing features such as spheres, diffuse materials, and basic "lighting".
- **Extendable Codebase**: Structured and commented code, ready for further experimentation and enhancement.
- **Performance Metrics**: Basic profiling to understand the performance implications of various features.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This project uses [Magick++](https://imagemagick.org/script/magick++.php) to open the image after compiling. Make sure you have them [installed](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/tree/main) before proceeding.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
     https://github.com/HopeSuffers/inOneWeekend.git

## Usage
Open the project in your preffered IDE and compile.
